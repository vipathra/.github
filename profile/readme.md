### 🙋‍♀️ Introduction

We are building open-source electronic invoicing platform. We’ve been doing this since April, 2023.

### 🎯 Objective

1. To build an open-source electronic invoicing platform that is also ad-free.
2. To build a sustainable, resilient, cost-effective, and responsible ecosystem that is focused on the betterment of society in the field of electronic invoicing.
3. To organise and host awareness programmes to promote the use of electronic invoices and enable people to contribute positively to the environment.
4. To encourage and create awareness in society about how to integrate our open-source electronic invoicing platform.
5. To promote livelihood development and community development by helping people move away from traditional methods such as paper-based invoicing, which are prone to corruption, black money, and blackmail.
